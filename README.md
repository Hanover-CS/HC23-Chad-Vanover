## What is my project?

My project, Cheesy, is designed to be an intuitive chess program that's easy to use and understand.

## How to run the program?

In the command line, type: `npm run start`.

## How to run tests?

There are two different testing suites Cheesy uses, Jest for unit tests and WebDriver for ui testing.

To run unit tests in the command line, type: `npm run unitTest`.

To run ui tests, you first need to run `board.html` as a live server. Then, in the command line, type: `npm run uiTest`.

## How to update documentation?

In the command line, type: `npm run doc`. The results are placed in the `out` directory.
