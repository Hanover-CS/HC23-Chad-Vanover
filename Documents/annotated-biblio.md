1. [Lichess](https://lichess.org/)
    Lichess, being a primary source, is a popular website where users can play chess made by Thibault Duplessis. It's a competing program in regards to mine as it is an open source multiplayer chess program. It is under the [AGPL license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Affero_General_Public_License). Users can play games with random people, friends and AI. It also offers a coaching system where users can request help from excellent players. Further, users can make an account to track their progress. According to [Lichess source](https://lichess.org/source), it is comprised of many languages due to the differences in front-end to back-end code, but mainly Scala and Typescript.

    I plan for my to be open source as well as letting players play against each other. However, I'm not sure if making invites will be entirely feasible, nor an AI or coaching. While it isn't required for users to play on Lichess, I probably won't make an account system as some users are driven away from it. I probably won't be using Scala and Typescript, as I'm not familiar with the languages. A very specific confusion I had with the site was trying to play in a game I created, but this may be due to my unfamiliarity with it.
2. [Multiplayer Chess](https://www.chessmultiplayer.com/)
    Multiplayer chess, another primary source, is a website where users can play chess. It has an online mode where a list of lobbies will be appear, which a user could then select one or use their "quick game" feature, as well as a local mode where one can play against a bot or another player on the same machine. The website itself is littered with ads, which is personally frustrating. the game itself doesn't seem to run very well. The website also features an "article" section, of which I'm not entirely certain is useful. There seems to be no way of seeing who made the website or what langauge it's in on the page itself.

    I could see the online lobby mode being more feasible than Lichess' invitation system, as well as the local two player mode, however I'm still unsure of making a bot. if users are wanting a bot, they can use Lichess or something equivalent. If it's randomization and ease of use, that's where my program comes in.
3. [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/)
    Written by Erik Allebest in Java, Javascript and PHP, chess.com is a more direct competitor with Lichess. As of this annotation, it has 216,000 people playing in comparison to Lichess' 41,000. As such, chess.com has a huge community in comparison. It has a very similar list of features on its sidebar to Lichess, only larger. This could be seen as a good or bad thing, of which I'm of the opinion that some features are unneccesary for someone just looking to play some chess. Similar to Lichess, it also features a coaching system where high-level players can offer their services to players seeking some sort of advancement. Also like Lichess, players can play online with other people, against a bot, in tournaments, with friends and chess varities. However, one must make an account to play variants unlike Lichess, which i find to be strange.

    I believe chess.com features a bit more than it needs to, which could lead to users feeling overwhelmed. Specifically, its news section and its more section feels too bloated for a program designed for players to play chess. It is interestig to me though that despite all of its similarites with Lichess,
